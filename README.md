Oh man, I just got out of Uppercut and my brain feels scrambled like those egg-frying summer mornings in that kitchen, you remember? I can still hear the crunch of popcorn under my feet and, ugh, my back is killing me from those seats. Can they not invest in some decent cushions? Anyway, the  , right? Geez, where do I even begin? It’s like trying to rearrange a garden in a storm—chaotic, messy, but you find beauty in the disorder.

The opening scene hits you like a spade to the face, so fast and unexpected. And those camera angles, were they supposed to be that dramatic or did the camera guy have too much caffeine? I don’t know, but it worked. It's like planting a palm tree in your backyard and suddenly you're in the tropics. The main character, what’s-his-name, he had these punches that were like clumsy ballet dancers yet somehow graceful, like trying to arrange rose bushes in a way that doesn't prick you. 

> And the score, man, don't even get me started. It thrummed like a hundred bees buzzing around you, urgent, hectic, but also strangely comforting in its persistence. Reminded me of trying to stop the wind from rearranging the autumn leaves in the garden—impossible, you just give in and let it happen.

There was this scene—really punchy (ha!), like that time I thought profusion of colors would work in a single flower bed but I ended up with a riot. The dialogue, on the other hand... felt like overheard snippets in a crowded food court. Sometimes sharp, but often like when you can’t decide if the stranger is actually talking to you or someone else.
 
Oh, someone did ask if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or was it 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together? My brain's like a pile of pebbles right now, shifting every time the wind blows. Anyway, the ending, oh wow, was so much like when a sunbeam perfectly hits the dew on grass—blinding but worth it as it all comes together. And then it leaves you dazed, like waiting for a monarch butterfly to land but it just flutters away.

    for i in range(confusion):
    return none  # wait, what was I typing this for?
